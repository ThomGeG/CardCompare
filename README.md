# CardCompare

A price comparison tool for the budget conscious Australian collector.

CardCompare is a small python script for scraping pricing information from [GoodGames.com.au](https://goodgames.com.au) for cards defined in a [DeckBox.org](https://deckbox.org/) wishlist and comparing them against pricing information from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/).

## Installation

Installation steps for Python & Pip will vary across operation systems, however there are countless tutorials on the internet that detail how to do this.

## Usage

Simply run the following command with your own [DeckBox.org](https://deckbox.org/) account name.
```
python main.py <account_name>
